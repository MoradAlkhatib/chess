# Lab: Numpy Arrays


Your job is to render out chess boards with red and blue queens on them.


## Implementation Notes

[X]Define a ChessBoard class - should contain an 8x8 grid 

[x] Each cell in grid should have a color represented in RGB format. - black = (0,0,0) - white = (1,1,1) - blue = (0,1,1) - red = (1,.2,0)


[x]should have add_red method that accepts a row and column as input which colors corresponding cell.

[x]should have add_blue method that accepts a row and column as input which colors corresponding cell.

[x]should have render method that displays the chess board on screen with red and blue shown in correct locations

[x]should have is_under_attack method that return boolean if red is under attack by a blue piece horizontally, vertically or diagonally


[x]queens on same row should be “under attack”
[x]queens on same column should be “under attack”
[x]queens on same diagonal should be “under attack”
[x]queens with any other coordinates should NOT be “under attack”
